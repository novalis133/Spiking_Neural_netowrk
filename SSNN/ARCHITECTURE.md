# SSNN Architecture Documentation

## Design Patterns

### 1. Factory Pattern
- Implementation: `models/base.py` and `models/neurons.py`
- Used for creating different neuron models
- Allows dynamic instantiation of specific SNN variants

### 2. Strategy Pattern
- Implementation: Training methods and surrogate gradients
- Enables swapping between different:
  - Backpropagation methods (BPTT, RTRL, TBPTT)
  - Surrogate gradient functions

### 3. Observer Pattern
- Implementation: Training monitoring and logging
- Components:
  - Training progress tracking
  - Metrics collection
  - Result visualization

### 4. Template Method Pattern
- Implementation: Base SNN model
- Defines skeleton algorithm in base class
- Subclasses implement specific neuron behaviors

## Algorithms
### Neural Network Models
1. Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
   
   - Time constant: β
   - Membrane potential decay
2. Alpha Neuron
   
   - Dual time constants: α, β
   - Synaptic current modeling
3. Synaptic Model
   
   - Single synaptic current
   - Enhanced membrane dynamics
4. Lapicque Model
   
   - Classic integrate-and-fire
   - Basic threshold mechanism
### Training Methods
1. BPTT (Backpropagation Through Time)
   
   - Full gradient computation
   - Memory intensive
   - Higher accuracy
2. RTRL (Real-Time Recurrent Learning)
   
   - Online learning
   - Forward computation of gradients
   - Memory efficient
3. TBPTT (Truncated Backpropagation Through Time)
   
   - Limited time window
   - Balance between BPTT and RTRL
   - Memory-accuracy trade-off
## Design Principles
### 1. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each class has one primary purpose
- Open/Closed: New models without modifying existing code
- Liskov Substitution: Neuron models are interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Minimal required interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules independent of details
### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Configuration management
- Model implementation
- Training process
- Result analysis
- Data visualization
### 3. Modularity Benefits
- Independent testing
- Easy maintenance
- Component reusability
- Simplified debugging
- Parallel development
## System Features
