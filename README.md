üìÇ Project Structure
The repository is organized into distinct directories, each focusing on a specific SNN implementation:



Directory
Description
Tech Stack



NeuroSpike-MNIST
SNN for classifying the MNIST dataset using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Includes a training script and evaluation metrics.
PyTorch, SNNTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib


RSNN
Reinforcement learning with SNNs for the CartPole environment. Features a policy gradient method and a tutorial notebook.
PyTorch, SNNTorch, OpenAI Gym


SSNN
Supervised learning implementations with SNNs, including various neuron models and training strategies.
PyTorch, SNNTorch, NumPy



üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
PyTorch: Version 1.9 or higher
SNNTorch: Version 0.6 or higher
OpenAI Gym: For reinforcement learning (RSNN)
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib: For visualizations

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Novalis133/spiking-neural-networks.git
cd spiking-neural-networks


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv snn_env
source snn_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
snn_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install Dependencies:
pip install torch>=1.9.0 snntorch>=0.6.0 gym numpy matplotlib


Verify Installation:Run the following to check if dependencies are installed correctly:
python -c "import torch, snntorch, gym, numpy, matplotlib; print('All dependencies installed!')"



Troubleshooting:

Ensure PyTorch is compatible with your CUDA version (if using GPU). Check PyTorch's official site for installation commands.
If gym installation fails, try pip install gym==0.21.0 for compatibility.


üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Each project directory contains specific instructions in its own README.md. Below are quickstart commands:
NeuroSpike-MNIST
Train and evaluate the SNN on the MNIST dataset:
cd NeuroSpike-MNIST
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 128
python evaluate.py --model-path models/mnist_snn.pth

RSNN
Run the CartPole reinforcement learning environment:
cd RSNN
python cartpole_snn.py --episodes 1000
jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb  # For interactive tutorial

SSNN
Train a supervised SNN model:
cd SSNN
python supervised_snn.py --dataset custom_dataset --epochs 20

Note: Check each directory‚Äôs README.md for detailed configurations and dataset setup.

üßë‚Äçüíª Development Setup
Pre-commit Hooks
To maintain code quality, this project uses pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.

Install pre-commit:
pip install pre-commit


Set Up Hooks:
conda activate snn_env  # Or use your virtual environment
pre-commit install


Run Hooks:Hooks will automatically run on git commit to check code style (e.g., Black, Flake8). To run manually:
pre-commit run --all-files



Code Quality Tools

Black: For code formatting
Flake8: For linting
isort: For import sorting

Install these tools:
pip install black flake8 isort
